Air Quality Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict air quality based on various environmental factors using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains air quality parameters that help in forecasting pollution levels, providing insights for environmental monitoring and decision-making.
Dataset
•	File Name: AirQuality.csv
•	Description: The dataset includes multiple air quality parameters such as pollutant levels, meteorological data, and timestamps.
•	Features:
o	Timestamp
o	PM2.5 concentration
o	PM10 concentration
o	NO2, CO, SO2, O3 levels
o	Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, and other relevant features
•	Target Variable: Air Quality Index (AQI) or pollutant concentration levels.
Jupyter Notebook
•	File Name: Air Quality.ipynb
•	Contents:
o	Data loading and preprocessing
o	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
o	Feature selection and engineering
o	Model training (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or other ML models)
o	Performance evaluation using metrics such as RMSE, R² score
o	Visualization of predictions vs. actual values
Requirements
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:
Usage
1.	Load the dataset in Air Quality.ipynb.
